# Getting started

> warning This module only works for **[Muban 2.x](https://github.com/mubanjs/muban)**

Add `muban-transition-component` to your project:

```sh
npm install --save @mediamonks/muban-transition-component
```

## Add to your project

Before you can start using the GreenSock transitions in your project you will first need to provide
a `TransitionContext` for all child components.

### Basic implementation

This can be achieved by adding it to your `App` component through the `useGlobalTransitionContext`
hook.

```ts {2,7}
import { defineComponent } from '@muban/muban';
import { useGlobalTransitionContext } from '@mediamonks/muban-transition-component';

const MyComponent = defineComponent({
  name: 'app',
  setup() {
    useGlobalTransitionContext();
    return [];
  },
});
```

### Storybook implementation

Since Muban Storybook doesn't use the `App` you will have to also make sure the `TransitionContext`
is available there. Storybook has support for decorators that can be wrapped around your stories and
this is exactly what we are going to do.

Update the `.storybook/preview.js` file to include the following decorator logic:

```ts {2-4,6    -19}
import { useGlobalTransitionContext } from '@mediamonks/muban-transition-component';
import { defineComponent } from '@muban/muban';
import { createDecoratorComponent } from '@muban/storybook';

export const decorators = [
  createDecoratorComponent(({ component }) => {
    return {
      component: defineComponent({
        name: 'global-context',
        components: [component],
        setup() {
          useGlobalTransitionContext();
          return [];
        },
      }),
    };
  }),
];
```

### Page transition implementation

To enable page transitions you can use add the `usePageTransitions` hook to your `App` component.

```ts {2,7}
import { defineComponent } from '@muban/muban';
import { usePageTransitioning } from '@mediamonks/muban-transition-component';

const MyComponent = defineComponent({
  name: 'app',
  setup() {
    usePageTransitioning();
    return [];
  },
});
```

> This hook is an extension on the `useGlobalTransitionContext` hook described in the previous
> section.

> danger The automated `transitionOut` logic is still a todo!

## Component transitions

You can now create transition components by using one of the following hooks:

- `useTransitionController`
- `usePageTransition`
- `useScrollTransition`

## Muban Storybook

You might not want to trigger transitions when you open up a component in Storybook, but you might
still want to be able to preview/test them.

This can be done by installing `muban-storybook-addon-transition` in your project.

```sh
yarn add @mediamonks/muban-storybook-addon-transition
```

```sh
npm install --save @mediamonks/muban-storybook-addon-transition
```

After installing the package you can add it to the `main.ts` file in the `.storybook` directory.

```ts
module.exports = {
  stories: [],
  addons: ['@mediamonks/muban-storybook-addon-transition'],
};
```

To make sure the addon can find the timelines you'll have to expose the `TransitionContext` on the
`Window`. This can be done by updating the `.storybook/preview.js` file and make sure we store the
return value.

```ts
...
window.parent.window.transitionContext = useGlobalTransitionContext();
...
```

After adding the addon you will now have a "Transitions" tab in Storybook that can be used to
control the timeline for the current active component.
