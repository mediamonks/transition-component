# useScrollTransition

This hook can be used when you want to attach a timeline GreenSock's ScrollTrigger functionality. It
basically has the same configuration options as the `useTransitionController` does with two major
differences:

1. The addition of the `scrollTrigger` key, which has all the same options as
   [ScrollTrigger](https://greensock.com/docs/v3/Plugins/ScrollTrigger).
2. The default value for the `registerTransitionController` is set to `false`.

```ts {2,7-10}
import { defineComponent } from '@muban/muban';
import { useScrollTransition } from '@mediamonks/muban-transition-component';

const MyComponent = defineComponent({
  name: 'some-page-component',
  setup() {
    useScrollTransition(refs.self, {
      // Add your transition configuration.
      // It supports the same as the `useTransitionController` hook.
    });

    return [];
  },
});
```

> warning When using this hook there will be no Promise returned by the `transitionIn` /
> `transitionOut` methods, you can still use the regular event callbacks in the setupOptions though.

## Global ScrollTrigger variables

In some scenarios you might want to set some ScrollTrigger variables for all components that are
children of a certain component.

An example scenario might be a lightbox like component with it's own scrollbar that is displayed on
top of your main application. In this scenario you will need to define a
[scroller](https://greensock.com/docs/v3/Plugins/ScrollTrigger/scroller) to ensure that `gsap` uses
the correct scrollbar for triggering the transitions.

```ts {2,7,11,13-16}
import { defineComponent, refElement } from '@muban/muban';
import { provideScrollContext, ScrollContext } from '@mediamonks/muban-transition-component';

const SomeParentComponent = defineComponent({
  name: 'some-parent-component',
  refs: {
    content: refElement('content'),
  },
  setup({ refs }) {
    // Provide the context to set the global properties.
    provideScrollContext(
      // You can set all of the properties that are supported by the ScrollTrigger plugin.
      new ScrollContext({
        scroller: refs.content.element,
      }),
    );

    return [];
  },
});
```

> tip The child still has the final say on what will be executed. So if you provide the same
> properties to the configuration of your child's `useScrollTransition` hook, they will overwrite
> the global ones.
