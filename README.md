## 🎩 Examples

- [Muban example](./examples/muban) - An example implementation of the `muban-transition-component`
  package in Muban.

> **Starting the examples**
>
> The examples are dependent on the packages in this repository, so to get them to work you'll have
> to do the following:
>
> 1. Checkout the entire Git repository (not just the example folder).
> 2. Run `npm install` in the root of the Git repository to install all dependencies.
> 3. Change directory to the desired example folder, for example `cd examples/muban`.
> 4. Start up the development server by running `npm run dev`.
